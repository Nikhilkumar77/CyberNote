/*
  # Create Notes Table

  1. New Tables
    - `notes`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for each note
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key) - References auth.users
      - `title` (text) - Note title
      - `content` (text) - Note content/body
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - When the note was created
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - When the note was last updated

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `notes` table
    - Add policy for users to read their own notes
    - Add policy for users to insert their own notes
    - Add policy for users to update their own notes
    - Add policy for users to delete their own notes

  3. Important Notes
    - All notes are private to the user who created them
    - Authentication is required for all operations
    - No public access to any notes
